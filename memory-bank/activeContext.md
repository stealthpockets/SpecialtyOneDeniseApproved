#### Outstanding Priority Issues
3. **About Page Timeline Inaccuracy** - Shows company history 1999-2024, but Specialty One started this year (needs complete rewrite)

#### Priority 2 - UX Issues (High Priority)
4. **Page Navigation Bug** - Pages don't scroll to top when navigating between different pages
5. **Missing Favicons** - Need implementation across all media types for proper branding
6. **Fake Content Labeling** - Buyer network "Recent Off-Market Successes" and testimonials need clear "not real" labels

#### Priority 3 - Content & Feature Gaps (Medium Priority)
7. **Mock Network Data Replacement** - Off-market deals and testimonials in buyer network page need real content or proper disclaimers
8. **Track Record Page Missing** - Need dedicated page with done deals and map visualization
9. **Typeform Integration Missing** - CTAs need connection to actual typeform forms
10. **Photo Optimization Analysis** - Need to identify additional conversion-focused photo placement opportunities

#### Priority 4 - Backend Integration (Development Priority)
11. ✅ **Supabase Backend Connection** - Case study detail pages AND success story modals now fully connected
12. ✅ **Cloudinary Integration Fixed** - Versioning issue resolved, images now load from CDN properly
13. **Form Integration** - Contact forms need backend processing

## Recent Completion: Button Legibility Fix ✅

### Problem Identified
Multiple CTA buttons across the website had **purple text (`text-plum`) on purple gradient backgrounds** making them completely illegible. This was caused by conflicting CSS classes where:
- `variant="primary"` applied purple gradient background with white text
- `className="text-plum"` overrode the white text with purple text
- Result: Purple text on purple gradient = illegible

### Pages Fixed
1. **SuccessPage.tsx**: "Write Your Success Story" and "Start Your Story" buttons
2. **AboutPage.tsx**: "Work With Our Team" and "Start the Conversation" buttons  
3. **InsightsPage.tsx**: "Subscribe for Insights" and "Get the Tools" buttons
4. **MarketReportsPage.tsx**: "Subscribe for Reports" and "Subscribe for Free Reports" buttons
5. **ExclusiveBuyerNetworkPage.tsx**: "Apply for Access" button
6. **ExclusiveSellerNetworkPage.tsx**: "Request Confidential Consultation" button

### Technical Solution
- Removed conflicting `className` overrides that set `text-plum` on primary buttons
- Let `variant="primary"` handle styling properly (white text on purple gradient)
- Fixed TypeScript errors in form submission buttons
- Fixed typo in MarketReportsPage.tsx imports (`aimport` -> `import`)

### Result
All CTA buttons now have proper contrast and legibility:
- Primary buttons: White text on purple gradient (high contrast)
- Secondary buttons: Purple text on white background (high contrast)
- All buttons meet accessibility standards for readability
