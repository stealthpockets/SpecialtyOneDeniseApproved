# Active Context - Specialty One Website

## Current Project State

### Infrastructure Crisis RESOLVED âœ…
- **Memory Bank Migration**: Successfully moved from `.bolt/memory-bank/` to `memory-bank/` for LLM accessibility
- **Cline Rules Migration**: Successfully moved from `.bolt/.clinerules` to `.clinerules` for proper visibility
- **Documentation Updated**: All memory bank files now properly accessible and updated with current issues

### Current Critical Issues Identified ðŸš¨

#### Priority 1 - Critical Bugs (Immediate Fix Required)
1. **Case Study Dynamic Loading Bug** - All individual case study pages (`/success/the-palms`, `/success/american-self-storage`) show hardcoded "Caravan Oasis" content regardless of URL slug
2. **Button Readability Crisis** - Plum text on purple/plum gradients making CTA buttons unreadable across multiple pages
3. **About Page Timeline Inaccuracy** - Shows company history 1999-2024, but Specialty One started this year (needs complete rewrite)

#### Priority 2 - UX Issues (High Priority)
4. **Page Navigation Bug** - Pages don't scroll to top when navigating between different pages
5. **Missing Favicons** - Need implementation across all media types for proper branding
6. **Fake Content Labeling** - Buyer network "Recent Off-Market Successes" and testimonials need clear "not real" labels

#### Priority 3 - Content & Feature Gaps (Medium Priority)
7. **Mock Network Data Replacement** - Off-market deals and testimonials in buyer network page need real content or proper disclaimers
8. **Track Record Page Missing** - Need dedicated page with done deals and map visualization
9. **Typeform Integration Missing** - CTAs need connection to actual typeform forms
10. **Photo Optimization Analysis** - Need to identify additional conversion-focused photo placement opportunities

#### Priority 4 - Backend Integration (Development Priority)
11. **Supabase Backend Connection** - Case studies need real database connection instead of mock data
12. **Form Integration** - Contact forms need backend processing

## Project Overview
This is a **production-ready React + TypeScript website** for Specialty One, a specialized commercial real estate brokerage. Currently at ~85% completion with critical bugs preventing proper functionality.

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.5.3
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 + Custom CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 6.22.1
- **Backend**: Supabase (configured but not connected)

### Current Status
- **Dependencies**: All npm packages installed and ready
- **Development Server**: Ready to start with `npm run dev`
- **Supabase**: Environment variables configured, database schema exists
- **Memory Bank**: Now properly accessible for all LLMs

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes

3. Analyze and implement photo optimization opportunities

### Phase 4: Backend Integration
1. Connect case studies to Supabase database
2. Implement contact form processing
3. Replace all mock data with real content

## Development Environment Notes

### Supabase Integration Status
- **Environment Variables**: Properly configured in `.env`
- **URL**: `https://fttgppbopdxjbzexntlc.supabase.co`
- **Database Schema**: Complete case studies table structure exists
- **Connection**: Ready but not actively used (still using mock data)

### Known Technical Debt
- Case study hook uses mock data instead of Supabase queries
- Some npm security vulnerabilities (6 total: 1 low, 4 moderate, 1 high)
- Asset paths assume `/dist/assets/` structure

## Business Context Reminders

### Primary Goals
- **Lead Generation**: Convert visitors to contacts
- **Credibility Building**: Showcase $1B+ transaction history  
- **Expertise Demonstration**: Position as alternative property specialists
- **Network Growth**: Build exclusive buyer/seller communities

### Key Messaging
- "$1B+ in Total Transactions"
- "100% Success on Exclusive MH & RV Listings"

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Fix case study dynamic loading** - Most critical user-facing bug
2. **Button readability fixes** - Essential for conversion optimization
3. **About page timeline correction** - Important for credibility
