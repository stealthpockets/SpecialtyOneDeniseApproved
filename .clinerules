# Specialty One Website - Development Patterns

## Core Architecture
- Bolt.new/StackBlitz origin: Use standard Vite + React + TypeScript patterns
- Component structure: Layout/ (wrappers), home/ (sections), ui/ (reusables), pages/ (routes)
- Design system: Custom Tailwind with plum/amethyst/evergreen brand colors + sand background

## Content & Data Patterns  
- Mock data in useCaseStudies.ts ready for Supabase integration
- Asset paths expect /dist/assets/ structure for images
- Case studies use slug-based routing (/success/:slug)
- TypeScript interfaces comprehensive and production-ready

## Styling Conventions
- Lucide React for all icons
- Staggered animations with animationDelay: `${0.2 * index}s`
- Gradient backgrounds: plum→amethyst, evergreen→sage
- Button variants: primary (gradient), secondary (outline), custom hover states

## Business Context
- Alternative commercial real estate (manufactured housing, RV parks, self-storage)
- Key messaging: "$1B+ transactions", "100% success", "specialist vs generalist" positioning
- Lead generation focus: contact forms, exclusive networks, market reports

## Development Notes
- Ready for production at ~85% completion
- Missing: real content, backend integration, professional photography
- Dependencies installed, no custom WebContainer configs needed

## Critical Issues Identified (Current Session)
- CaseStudyDetailPage shows hardcoded "Caravan Oasis" for all slugs
- Button readability: plum text on purple gradients needs white/cloud text
- About timeline inaccurate (shows 1999-2024, company started this year)
- Pages don't scroll to top on navigation
- Buyer network mock data needs "not real" labels
- Missing favicons, track record page, typeform integration
