- **Market Reports**: Download functionality needs implementation

## Development Environment Notes

### Bolt.new Compatibility
- Originally built on Bolt.new (StackBlitz WebContainers)
- All Vite plugins standard and compatible
- No custom WebContainer-specific configurations needed
- Can run locally or redeploy to Bolt.new/StackBlitz

- Asset paths assume `/dist/assets/` structure
- Supabase integration prepared but not active
