# Specialty One Website - Development Patterns

## Core Architecture
- Bolt.new/StackBlitz origin: Use standard Vite + React + TypeScript patterns
- Component structure: Layout/ (wrappers), home/ (sections), ui/ (reusables), pages/ (routes)
- Design system: Custom Tailwind with plum/amethyst/evergreen brand colors + sand background

## Content & Data Patterns  
- ✅ Supabase integration: Case studies and testimonials connected
- Asset paths expect /dist/assets/ structure for images
- Case studies use slug-based routing (/success/:slug)
- TypeScript interfaces comprehensive and production-ready

## Styling Conventions - CRITICAL BUTTON PATTERN
- Lucide React for all icons
- Staggered animations with animationDelay: `${0.2 * index}s`
- Gradient backgrounds: plum→amethyst, evergreen→sage
- ⚠️ NEVER override primary button text color: variant="primary" = white text on gradient
- Button variants: primary (gradient + white text), secondary (outline), never mix

## Business Context
- Alternative commercial real estate (manufactured housing, RV parks, self-storage)
- Key messaging: "$1B+ transactions", "100% success", "specialist vs generalist" positioning
- Lead generation focus: contact forms, exclusive networks, market reports

## Development Notes
- Ready for production at ~95% completion
- ✅ Backend connected, case studies working, buttons legible
- ✅ Complete Insights & Market Reports content system with ArticleDetail pages
- Missing: About timeline fix, scroll-to-top, mock data labels, favicons

## Critical Issues RESOLVED ✅
- ✅ FIXED: CaseStudyDetailPage dynamic loading
- ✅ FIXED: Success story modals use Supabase data  
- ✅ FIXED: Button legibility crisis (purple text on purple gradients)
- ✅ FIXED: Complete Insights & Market Reports system (ArticleDetail, routing, SEO, social sharing)
- About timeline inaccurate (shows 1999-2024, company started this year)
- Pages don't scroll to top on navigation
- Buyer network mock data needs "not real" labels
